This is a Minesweeper game done using the java programming language as a student project done as a team by 
Arturo Iturriaga and Daniela Becerra
It has fun spongebob graphics and the Mexican flag to mark down mines. Spongebob rights belong to Nickelodeon
It has all the basic functions of a normal minesweeper game
You can either generate 8x8 or 16x16 fields, they can be generated randomly or you can use your own field from a .txt file
using the format on the other txt files in the project. Be sure to place only 10 or 40 mines depending on the level.

The main File to run is VentanaJuego.java on the src folder
If you're using eclipse you're good to go, 
if you're using the command line, the .java files should be in the same directory as all the pictures.


Have fun!

Daniela
